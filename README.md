# Image-De-noising-by-Various-Filters-for-Different-Noise-using-MATLAB-OCTAVE
Image processing is basically the use of computer algorithms to perform image processing on digital images. Digital image processing is a part of digital signal processing. Digital image processing has many significant advantages over analog image processing. Image processing allows a much wider range of algorithms to be applied to the input data and can avoid problems such as the build-up of noise and signal distortion during processing of images. One of the most popular methods is wiener filter. In this project three types of noise (Gaussian noise , Salt & Pepper noise and Speckle noise) is used and image de-noising performed for different noise by Mean filter, Median filter and Wiener filter,FIR filter . Further results have been compared for all noises.
